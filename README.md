# Pegstr - Pegboard Wizard
### Parametric Peg Board Mounts Generator
* Infinite ways to create pegboard holders and bins for tools or display objects.* 

### Highlights:
* One or multiple (mâ€¢n matrix) objects per holder
* Different sized objects in the same holder
* Round, square or rectangular with rounded corners
* Generate various shapes of bins and trays (closed bottom)
* Chose between stronger or economical, straight or tapered, etc
* Can be partially open (to click / snap in objects) and angled up or down

### Notes
* This is designed to work with US-style pegboard (1/4" holes, 1" spaced).
* The original project is CC-NC (Creative Commons - Attribution - Non-Commercial),
  and thus so is this one. I think if you wanted to use it commercially, you would
  need to get permission from both me and the original creator.
